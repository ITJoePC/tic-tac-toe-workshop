# Making A Game: Tic-Tac-Toe (Step 4)

This is a set of workshop files for writing (parts of) a JS + `<canvas>` Tic-Tac-Toe game.

The workshop is organized into multiple steps, each in their own branch:

* [Step 1](../step-1/README.md): drawing the grid lines
* [Step 2](../step-2/README.md): drawing the X's and O's
* [Step 3](../step-3/README.md): detecting and showing a win or a tie
* [Step 4](../step-4/README.md): adding a computer player
* [Final](../final/README.md): final solution branch

Go through the steps in order, and compare your code to the beginning of each next-step before moving on, to make sure you're getting everything in the right place.

## Extra Credit

Things you can consider adding to this game to make it more fun to play:

* Add buttons/controls to select "2-player", "Easy Computer Mode", or "Hard Computer Mode"
* Add a "reset game" button so you can start a new game
* Add score tracking between X's and O's
